# Simplified Infrastructure for Hackathon

This directory contains a minimal version of the infrastructure required for this project. We've simplified the Azure deployment scripts to make development easier during the hackathon.

## What's Included

- Basic configuration templates
- Simplified environment setup

## Getting Started

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` at the project root
2. Fill in the required variables with your Azure service information
3. Focus on development rather than infrastructure automation
